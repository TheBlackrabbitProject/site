import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'

<Aside type="caution">This article will be updated to cover a lot more areas. If you ran into any problems during the process, try closing the terminal and re-opening it again.</Aside>

## Requirements

To build TBP's source code, you need:
- **[NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)** with NPM installed. Version `v20.3.0` or higher.
- **Text Editor/IDE** like Visual Studio Code with Astro support/extension installed.
- **Git** because we need it to download and save our changes.
- **Terminal** because some of the components we use only run in CLI.
- **Small knowledge on Markdown** because it's all you need to make pages is Markdown.

## Cloning the repository and building.

1. Create an account or use an existing account on [GitHub](https://github.com).
2. Fork the repository using the button "Fork" on the top of the page.
3. Open a CMD or PowerShell terminal and run

```bash title="Terminal"
git clone https://github.com/<your username here>/index.git --recurse-submodules
```

4. Enter the source code directory using

```bash title="Terminal"
cd index
```

5. Install dependencies

```bash title="Terminal"
npm install
```

6. Congratulations! You built the source code successfully!

## Change the source code and hosting the site locally

You need to change the site locally to test it. This section will teach you everything you need to change and host.

1. Run this command. This command sets up a local host instance that you can open in your browser.

```bash title="Terminal"
npm run dev
```

2. Open `localhost:4321` on your browser.

3. Congratulations! You successfully hosted the site. Don't worry, every change will make the browser instance change.

## Commiting and Pull requesting.

Before the changes make into the official site, we need to review them. For us to review your changes, you need to pull request them. Here's how to setup a pull request:

1. Run this on your terminal, this command will add all of the necessary directories to the source code.

```bash title="Terminal"
git add .
```

2. Run this. This command will commit your changes.

```bash title="Terminal"
git commit -m "<Insert a title here that explains the changes.>"
```

3. Push the changes to your own repository.

```bash title="Terminal"
git push -u origin main
```

4. Go to your repository's page and create a pull request. Please follow these rules when making a pull request:

- Put a good and descriptive title;
- If the change is adding a fangame, put a link for the fangame;
- Use the page template if the change is a fangame.
