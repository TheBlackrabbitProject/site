 {/* Description */}

    POPGOES is an indie point-and-click Five Nights at Freddy's fangame developed by a worldwide team. It started as a joke in the r/2124 subreddit and later became a real game. 

    The game takes place in November 2024 and tells the story of Fritz Glade and his daughter, Bonnie. In the game, we play as a robot called "Strings", which was created as a Dreamcatcher and then later repurposed to be a security guard.

    Our objective is to stop Popgoes The Weasel from creating the Blackrabbit, the main antagonist of the game.
