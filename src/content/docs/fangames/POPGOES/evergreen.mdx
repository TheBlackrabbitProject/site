POPGOES Evergreen is an official, fan developed Five Nights at Freddy's spin off that only takes the first three FNAF games into account. 

The game tells the story of an inventor that single-handedly revived the animatronic restaurant genre with his own location called "The Popgoes Pizzeria". Promising safety with his advanced and well-behaved animatronics, the man believes that this will be the best family restaurant ever.
